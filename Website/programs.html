        <h2>Harambee Dinner Programs and Analysis</h2>
        <p>Even though the Harambee dinner has been held annually for more than 30 years, only eight dinner programs existed in the Penn State Behrend Archives in 2018. These programs have been processed and you can click the links below to view them. These programs were placed at each seat for guests to view the schedule of events, the menu, and a list of the individuals and clubs that made the event possible. Both the page and the text will be displayed side-by-side for you to explore the history of the Harambee dinner.</p>
