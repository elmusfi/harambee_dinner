                  Hosted every fall semester at Penn State Behrend by the MCC. These programs

               <p>Harambee is Swahili for "Let us all pull together" and originated in the
                  country of Kenya as a slogan for national unity. We use this celebration
                  as a way to unite our campus community and celebrate the cultures and
                  richness of diversity that is represented among our students, faculty,
                  and staff.

               <p>Harambee is Swahili for “Let us all pull together” and originated in the
                  country of Kenya as a slogan for national unity. Today we use this
                  slogan as a way to unite our campus community as we celebrate HARAMBEE'S
                  25TH ANNIVERSARY of cultural enrichment and diversity that is
                  represented among our students, faculty, and staff.

               <p>Welcome to the 27th Annual Harambee Dinner Thursday, October 17, 2013</p>
               
               
               <p>Harambee is Swahili for “Let us all pull together”, it originated in the
                  country of Kenya as a slogan for national unity. We use this celebration
                  as a way to unite our campus community and to celebrate the culture and
                  richness of diversity represented among our students, faculty and
                  staff.
